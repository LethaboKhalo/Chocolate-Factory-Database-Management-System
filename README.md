# 🍫 Chocolate Factory Database Management System

📖 Project Overview
The Chocolate Factory Database Management System is a relational database solution designed to help a fictional chocolate factory efficiently manage its core operations — including **customers, orders, inventory, employees, and production.**  
The system streamlines data organization, improves traceability, and supports decision-making by providing a centralized and normalized database structure.

🎯 Objectives
- Organize and manage all operational data in one database.  
- Ensure data consistency and accuracy through normalization.  
- Enable quick access to customer, order, and product information.  
- Support managers with queries and reports for operational insights.  

🧩 Key Features
- 👥 **Customer Management:** Store and update customer information.  
- 📦 **Order Tracking:** Record orders, items, quantities, and delivery details.  
- 🏭 **Inventory Management:** Monitor raw materials and finished product stock levels.  
- 👩‍💼 **Employee Records:** Manage staff information and job roles.  
- 📊 **Reporting Tools:** Generate summary reports for orders, sales, and stock.  
- ✅ **Data Validation:** Input constraints and referential integrity to ensure data reliability.
